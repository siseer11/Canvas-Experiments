# Canvas Practice
A small project that have a really nice look, that can make a web page look much more interactive.

# About the project
- i have seen the idea on codepen and tried it myself, in my own style, more colourful.

- the basic idea is that there are a lot of small points( particles ), moving arround randomly with different speeds.

- when the distance between them is smaller then X px, a line is drawn between them, creating a really nice 'webb-style' look

- to add a bit more reality to it, the opacity of the line is set depending on the distance between the points( big distance between points = low opacity, small distance = high opacity)
